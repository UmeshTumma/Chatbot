# 🧠 LangChain-Based AI Project

## 📘 Overview
This project is developed using **LangChain**, a framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)**.  
It focuses on applying LangChain’s logical components — such as **PromptTemplate**, **Chains**, **Agents**, and **Memory** — to create an intelligent and context-aware system.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic prompt management using LangChain’s `PromptTemplate`
- Multi-step logical reasoning via `LLMChain`
- Integration with external APIs and tools
- Conversational memory for contextual responses

## 🧩 LangChain Logic & Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **PromptTemplate** | Used to dynamically structure and inject variables into model prompts. |
| **LLMChain** | A sequence of prompts and model outputs forming logical workflows. |
| **Agents** | Enable decision-making by selecting tools or APIs based on input queries. |
| **Memory** | Stores user interaction history for contextual and personalized responses. |
| **Retrievers / Vector Stores** | Used for fetching relevant data or documents using embeddings. |
